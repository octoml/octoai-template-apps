# OctoAI Template Applications

These applications are meant as starter templates to help you quickly build production-grade apps on top of OctoAI's endpoints/ AI infrastructure.

We currently have a template application for real-time audio conversations between users and an AI system. That application is written in React/Typescript/NextJS, and is deployable on Vercel.

We also have a template application for image generation that can turn any portrait into a cartoon character. That application is written in Python, and is deployable on Streamlit.
